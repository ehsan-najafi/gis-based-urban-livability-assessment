Python Scripts for Assessing Urban Livability Factors

This section outlines the Python scripts used to evaluate various aspects of urban livability, including spatial accessibility, integration of raster indicators at the urban block level, and statistical data aggregation.



Phase 1: Evaluation of Accessibility to Six Essential Urban Services

This phase involves assessing accessibility by considering both the quantity of services available and their spatial distribution within the street network.

Phase 2: Integration of Remote Sensing Data at the Urban Block Level

In this phase, the average pixel values within each block unit were calculated using the Zonal Statistics function.

Phase 3: Integration of Socio-Economic Indicators

In this phase, the average statistical data were calculated at the neighborhood level to integrate socio-economic indicators.
